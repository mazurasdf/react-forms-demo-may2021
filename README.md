# Coding Dojo MERN May 2021 Forms demo

This project was made to represent the different ways we can build a form with live validations in React.
The Big Form component uses a state for each input, and a state for each validation message.
The Small Form component uses a single state with an object for all form inputs, as well as conditional formatting for validations.
